📊 Massachusetts Data Breach Analysis

Project Title: Unveiling Cyber Threats: An Empirical Analysis of Massachusetts Data Breaches

Overview

This repository contains a cleaned and structured dataset analyzing publicly reported data breaches in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The project focuses on identifying breach patterns, affected industries, disclosure timelines, and the impact on Massachusetts residents.

The dataset is intended for empirical cybersecurity research, policy analysis, and comparative state-level studies.

Data Source

The dataset is derived from publicly available Massachusetts data breach notifications. All records reflect disclosures as originally reported by organizations, with no inferred or synthesized values.

Dataset Description

Total records: 5,371 data breach incidents

Total fields: 14

Key attributes include:

Organization / primary subject

Industry classification

Breach type and issue category

Form of data involved

Number of affected individuals

Number of Massachusetts residents affected

Incident dates (start, end, discovery, notification)

Time to disclosure

Supplementary notes

Data Preparation

The dataset underwent structured preprocessing to ensure analytical usability while preserving data integrity:

Duplicate records removed

Column formats standardized

Breach and industry categories normalized

Date fields normalized for consistency

Inconsistent values corrected

Missing values intentionally preserved

Records with unclear or insufficient information were categorized as OTHER where necessary to maintain consistency without altering original disclosures.

Data Limitations

This dataset reflects real-world reporting constraints:

Some breach incidents lack complete timelines

Certain records do not report exact counts of affected individuals

Not all breach descriptions clearly specify technical details

Records with incomplete timelines are best suited for frequency-based and categorical analysis rather than precise time-series modeling.

Intended Use

This dataset supports research and analysis related to:

Data breach trends and patterns

Sector-specific cybersecurity risk

Disclosure delays and compliance behavior

Impact of breaches on state residents

Policy and regulatory evaluation
